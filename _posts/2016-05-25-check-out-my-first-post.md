<p>Several months ago, I enrolled in Launch Academy which is an online bootcamp for learning web development.  This blog will be a partial catalog of topics I learn.</p>
<p>I chose to use Jekyll for this project since it is Ruby software (which I have been learning)!  After installing the Jekyll gem, I created the blog you are reading using the very nice Utterson theme from <i><a>http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/utterson/.</a></i></p>

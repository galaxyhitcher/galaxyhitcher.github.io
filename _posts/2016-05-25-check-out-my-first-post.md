#Check Out My First Post

Several months ago, I enrolled in Launch Academy which is an online bootcamp for learning web development. This blog will be a partial catalog of topics I will encounter as I learn web development. I have learned Ruby and Sinatra so I decided to use Jekyll since it's a lightweight and Ruby-based blogging software. After installing the Jekyll gem, I created the blog you are reading using the very nice Utterson theme (from http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/utterson/).
